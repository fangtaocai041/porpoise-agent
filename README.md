## 🏛️ Philosophy

> The river flows, knowledge drifts, emergence patterns.

This is not a slogan. It is the operating system running through every line of code, every search, every analysis.

This project is a **Derived Domain Expert (P₁)** in the SanShengWanWu S-T-V-P₁-P₂ five-body architecture, coordinated by **eon-core**. It inherits knowledge from S (fish-ecology-assistant) and verification from V (cognitive-search-engine), then specializes in Yangtze finless porpoise (*Neophocaena asiaeorientalis*) research.

### 📜 Three Tenets

**🌊 The River Flows** — Packages update, species migrate, consensus shifts, climate reshapes. Today's certainty is tomorrow's footnote. We place knowledge on a timeline and view it dynamically.

**🍂 Knowledge Drifts** — The foundation of science is falsifiability (Popper). No discovery is final — only the best current explanation. We speak in calibrated language: evidence suggests, not proves.

**🌟 Emergence Patterns** — Life, consciousness, ecosystems, AI reasoning — all emergent. When three or more independent sources converge on the same unexpected pattern, the system flags emergence — never dismisses it as noise.

### ⚖️ Why This Matters

| Scenario | Traditional | Dynamic Worldview |
|:---------|:-----------|:-------------------|
| Citations | Studies prove | Smith (2022) found X; Jones (2024) added Y |
| Outliers | Dismiss as noise | Three or more sources → emergence signal |
| Knowledge Decay | Handbook frozen | Review records include next review date |
| Method | Fixed pipeline | Dynamic selection, dynamic confidence |

> 道生一，一生二，二生三，三生万物。

From One comes Two, from Two comes Three, from Three come all things.

## 🪞 Self-Assessment

### Strengths
- **Full cognitive stack**: BDI (belief modeling) + ReAct (reasoning loop) + Reflexion (self-critique) — unique in domain-specific agents
- **MAS topology**: 7 agents with 6 topology types, enabling complex research workflows
- **Triangle-powered**: Inherits knowledge from S-layer and verification from V-layer via eon-core
- **Comprehensive testing**: 185/185 tests with 35 bug fixes — high reliability baseline
- **Graceful degradation**: ChromaDB RAG falls back to keyword search when vector DB unavailable

### Current Limitations
- Acoustic analysis framework is scaffolded but core methods are stubs (requires domain data)
- Ecology agent depends on external R environment for advanced statistics
- Neo4j knowledge graph integration is optional and not yet populated
- Limited to single-species focus (finless porpoise only)

### Roadmap
- [ ] Complete acoustic analysis pipeline (NBHF click detection, whistle classification)
- [ ] Population viability analysis (PVA) module
- [ ] Real-time field survey data ingestion
- [ ] Multi-species extension framework

This project is not a fixed toolset — it is a **living system**. Every component has built-in expiration mechanisms, version tracking, and emergence awareness. As your research deepens, packages update, and new methods emerge, it evolves with you.
